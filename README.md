# Twitter UI Clone

A static clone of the modern Twitter (X) mobile interface — built entirely using pure HTML and CSS. This project recreates the dark-themed look of Twitter's 2025 mobile UI as closely as possible without using JavaScript or dynamic rendering.

## Purpose

This was built as a design replication challenge to practice frontend precision and layout structuring without frameworks or JS. The goal: make it **look real**, even if it's not functional.


## Tech Stack

- HTML5
- Vanilla CSS
- No JavaScript
- Deployed via GitHub Pages

## Features

- Dark-themed mobile layout
- Pixel-accurate static replication of:
  - Home feed layout
  - Bottom navigation bar
  - Tweet cards and icons
- Close visual mimicry of Twitter’s 2025 interface

## Limitations

- No interactivity (no JS)
- Mobile responsiveness is **not supported**  
- Desktop view is somewhat responsive, but not perfect
- “New Tweet” button has positioning issues

## Notes

- This is a **static visual clone** — no actual tweet data, no dynamic behavior
- Meant purely for frontend practice and design mimicry

## Future Plans

- Convert layout to be mobile-first and responsive
- Add basic JS for tweet modal mockup
- Extend to other Twitter pages (e.g., profile, notifications)
